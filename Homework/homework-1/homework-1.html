        The Fordham Data Science Agency
    </h1>
    <p>
        This business is run by a contractor with too many companies to manage, so he hires Fordham Students to handle
        his grunt work for minimum wage. They get paid minimum wage, and he doesn't have to do grunt work. It's that
        simple and easy!
