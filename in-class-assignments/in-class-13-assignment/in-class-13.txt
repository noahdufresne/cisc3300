1. variable names start with a $ in php 
2. Associative arrays behave a bit like objects in JS or dictionaries in python 
3. A template literal in PHP would be “${name}” 
4. php is loosely typed - we don’t set types for variables, they are assigned at runtime
5. The include or require statement takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and copies it into the file that uses the include statement.
